Time series are one of the most common data types encountered in daily life. There are many examples of data that can be collected at regular intervals, stock prices, weather conditions, energy usage etc. But what makes this kind of data so special? The main characteristics of time series data is that it is **time dependent**. Although data is usually continous and on graphs it might look like regular regression problem, the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent is not valid here.
